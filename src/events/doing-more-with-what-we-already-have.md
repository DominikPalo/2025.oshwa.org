Open access to used materials can fuel creative practice and contribute to a circular economy. This workshop includes a short tour and mini-make-a-thon at Concordia University’s Centre for Creative Reuse (CUCCR). Together, we will explore institutional waste reduction strategies, afterlives of objects and creative reuse, and make funky things from old electronics and other discarded materials! For instance, we will isolate electronics components and cast these in clear epoxy resin or glycerine to preserve and turn them into ornamental objects – keychains, necklaces, or bracelets.
