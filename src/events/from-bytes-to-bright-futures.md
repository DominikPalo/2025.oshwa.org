Danielle Boyer, a youth robotics inventor, is deeply committed to promoting educational equity within her Anishinaabe community. The Anishinaabeg, an Indigenous people group that has resided in the Great Lakes region of Canada and the United States for millenia, have faced systemic oppression resulting in the erosion of cultural heritage, diminished resources, and limited opportunities. Drawing from her experiences and passion for robotics, Boyer shares her innovative approach to addressing these challenges. Through the creation of personal robots, she weaves together elements of cultural education, language revitalization, and technical proficiency to bridge critical knowledge gaps and elevate her community’s prospects — all for free of cost. From adorable (and wearable) droids dedicated to language preservation to affordable robots costing less than $10, discover the power of using technology for good. Having impacted the lives of 800,000 youths and disbursing tens of thousands of robots, Boyer highlights the transformative potential of community engagement and grassroots initiatives in effecting enduring change.
